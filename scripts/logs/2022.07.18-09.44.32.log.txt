. * PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM) 
. *--------------------------------------------------
. * There is some debate about how to account for the estimation of the propensity score. Abadie and Imbens (2016) proved analytically t
> hat when matching with replacement, ignoring the propensity score estimation makes inferences conservative when estimating the ATE but
>  could go either way when estimating the ATT. However, when Bodory et al. (2020) performed a simulation study attempting to examine th
> e performance of Abadie and Imebns' proposed standard error estimator that accounts for propensity score estimation, they found it to 
> be anti-conservative, and that methods that ignored propensity score estimation performed better empirically. Austin's simulations als
> o indicate that ignoring the estimation of the propensity scores and using cluster-robust standard errors tends to be sufficient.
. * Matching was performed using a genetic matching algorithm (Diamond & Sekhon, 2013) as implemented in the Matching package (Sekhon, 2
> 011). Treatment effects were estimated using the Match function in Matching, which implements the matching estimators and standard err
> or estimators described by Abadie and Imbens (2006). To improve robustness, we performed bias correction on all continuous covariates 
> as described by Abadie and Imbens (2011) and implemented using the BiasAdjust option in the Match function.
. * My perspective is that the most mainstream practice is to perform regression in the matched sample, ignoring the variability due to 
> estimating the propensity score (if that was done) and due to matching, and possibly accounting for the correlation between paired uni
> ts. This is the advice given by Ho, Imai, King, & Stuart (2007). They argue that the analysis that you would have done before matching
>  is the one that you should do after matching, with no further adjustment for the matching. That means you can perform a t-test, run a
>  regression, or run any other kind of analysis in your matched set. It's likely that some of the assumptions of regression (linearity,
>  exogeneity) are better satisfied in the matched set than in the unmatched sample.

. * PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM) 
. *--------------------------------------------------
. * There is some debate about how to account for the estimation of the propensity score. Abadie and Imbens (2016) proved analytically t
> hat when matching with replacement, ignoring the propensity score estimation makes inferences conservative when estimating the ATE but
>  could go either way when estimating the ATT. However, when Bodory et al. (2020) performed a simulation study attempting to examine th
> e performance of Abadie and Imebns' proposed standard error estimator that accounts for propensity score estimation, they found it to 
> be anti-conservative, and that methods that ignored propensity score estimation performed better empirically. Austin's simulations als
> o indicate that ignoring the estimation of the propensity scores and using cluster-robust standard errors tends to be sufficient.
. * Matching was performed using a genetic matching algorithm (Diamond & Sekhon, 2013) as implemented in the Matching package (Sekhon, 2
> 011). Treatment effects were estimated using the Match function in Matching, which implements the matching estimators and standard err
> or estimators described by Abadie and Imbens (2006). To improve robustness, we performed bias correction on all continuous covariates 
> as described by Abadie and Imbens (2011) and implemented using the BiasAdjust option in the Match function.
. * My perspective is that the most mainstream practice is to perform regression in the matched sample, ignoring the variability due to 
> estimating the propensity score (if that was done) and due to matching, and possibly accounting for the correlation between paired uni
> ts. This is the advice given by Ho, Imai, King, & Stuart (2007). They argue that the analysis that you would have done before matching
>  is the one that you should do after matching, with no further adjustment for the matching. That means you can perform a t-test, run a
>  regression, or run any other kind of analysis in your matched set. It's likely that some of the assumptions of regression (linearity,
>  exogeneity) are better satisfied in the matched set than in the unmatched sample.

. * PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM) 
. *--------------------------------------------------
. * There is some debate about how to account for the estimation of the propensity score. Abadie and Imbens (2016) proved analytically t
> hat when matching with replacement, ignoring the propensity score estimation makes inferences conservative when estimating the ATE but
>  could go either way when estimating the ATT. However, when Bodory et al. (2020) performed a simulation study attempting to examine th
> e performance of Abadie and Imebns' proposed standard error estimator that accounts for propensity score estimation, they found it to 
> be anti-conservative, and that methods that ignored propensity score estimation performed better empirically. Austin's simulations als
> o indicate that ignoring the estimation of the propensity scores and using cluster-robust standard errors tends to be sufficient.
. * Matching was performed using a genetic matching algorithm (Diamond & Sekhon, 2013) as implemented in the Matching package (Sekhon, 2
> 011). Treatment effects were estimated using the Match function in Matching, which implements the matching estimators and standard err
> or estimators described by Abadie and Imbens (2006). To improve robustness, we performed bias correction on all continuous covariates 
> as described by Abadie and Imbens (2011) and implemented using the BiasAdjust option in the Match function.
. * My perspective is that the most mainstream practice is to perform regression in the matched sample, ignoring the variability due to 
> estimating the propensity score (if that was done) and due to matching, and possibly accounting for the correlation between paired uni
> ts. This is the advice given by Ho, Imai, King, & Stuart (2007). They argue that the analysis that you would have done before matching
>  is the one that you should do after matching, with no further adjustment for the matching. That means you can perform a t-test, run a
>  regression, or run any other kind of analysis in your matched set. It's likely that some of the assumptions of regression (linearity,
>  exogeneity) are better satisfied in the matched set than in the unmatched sample.
